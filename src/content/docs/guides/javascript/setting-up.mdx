There are many ways to set up your JavaScript environment with different advantages and disadvantages. This guide will help you get fully setup to start coding in JavaScript.

## Local development

This is the most flexible option as you can use any IDE you want and does not rely on an internet connection. This should be done on your personal computer and not on a school computer. This option also has the most complexity and learning due to all advanced features being available immediately.
For general use of JavaScript, it is highly recommended that you downlaod Node.js and npm. Do I say you need to install npm and Node.js so they can use React.js if they want? And a code editor, like IntelliJ or VS Code.
To use this option you will need to install a code editor, you can use any editor you would like, but we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
It is highly recommended that you install Node.js and npm. Node.js is an environment which can run JavaScript for different projects you can build, projects like a website! And `npm` is the package manager for the JavaScript library. A library is something which helps you code complicated programs by using other peoples' code (which means your 'hard' project will become easier to write and understand).
You can download this from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

### Installing Node.js

There are multiple ways to install Node.js, but the easiest way is to download the latest version from the [Node website](https://nodejs.org/en/download). Once you have downloaded the installer you can run it and follow the instructions to install Node.js.

You can also install Node using a package manager for a more advanced setup. If you are using macOS you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install Node. If you are using Linux you can use your package manager to install Node. If you are using Windows you can use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) to install Node.

:::note[How do I run commands on my computer?]
To run commands on your computer you will need to open a terminal. On macOS and Linux you can open a terminal by pressing `⌘ + Space` and typing `Terminal`. On Windows you can open a terminal by pressing `⊞ + Space` and typing `Terminal`. You can then run the command by typing it into the terminal and pressing `Enter`. The `$` is not part of the command and is just used to show that it is a command. You should not type the `$` when running the command.

<TabItem label="Chocolatey">

```sh
choco install nodejs.install
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Homebrew">

```sh
brew install node
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Linux">

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="asdf">

```sh
asdf plugin-add nodejs
asdf install nodejs latest
asdf global nodejs
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once you have installed Node you can check that it has installed correctly by running the following commands:

```sh
Node --version
npm --version
```



You should get an output *similar* to the following:

```sh
v18.16.1
9.8.0
```

### Setting up a project

To set up a project you will need to create a new folder for your project. You can then open this folder in your code editor.
In the directory of your project folder (either in the terminal app or VS Code terminal), you will need to create a `package.json` file.
This is the virtual environment for your project. You can do this by running the following command:

```sh
npm init -y
```
The file provides the node package manager (npm) with various information to help identify the project and handles your requests via the terminal.
If you want to, you can change the files' `description` and `author` to your projects description and your name!
You can then install libraries using the node package manager.

### Adding libraries

You can add libraries to your project by running the following command:

```sh
npm install <library>
```

## Next steps

### Using Node Package Manager (npm)

### Useful libraries

There are several libraries that are useful when programming in JavaScript and can help with either style/formatting, type checking or the general structure of you code.

#### Style and formatting

These libraries help with formatting and style of your code, they can be used to automatically format your code to a standard style and can also be used to check your code for style errors. They should be added to your style dependencies using the below commands.

- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/)

You can add them by running the following commands separately:

```sh
npm install eslint --save-dev
npm install --save-dev eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier
```

Once you have done this, you will see that you now have three files: `node_modules`, `package-lock.json` and `package.json`.
If you are in a terminal, you can see your current files by running this command: `ls`.

##### Using Prettier Formatter

Prettier is a JavaScript formatter that will automatically format your code to a standard style. You can run Prettier by running the following command:

```sh
poetry run black .
```

##### Using Flake8

Flake8 is a Python linter that will check your code for style errors. You can run Flake8 by running the following command:

```sh
poetry run flake8 .
```

#### Type checking

These libraries help with type checking your code, they can be used to check your code for type errors. They should be added to the test dependencies using the below commands.

- [MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

You can add them by running the following command:

```sh
poetry add mypy --group test
```

##### Using MyPy

MyPy is a Python type checker that will check your code for type errors. You can run MyPy by running the following command:

```sh
poetry run mypy .
```

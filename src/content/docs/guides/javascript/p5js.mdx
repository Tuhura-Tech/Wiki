## Intro

p5.js is a JavaScript library which implements your own canvas for creating interactive projects - the web browser is your limit :)

If you want to know more about this library, the official website is <a href="https://p5js.org/get-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
Have a look around and click on the examples on the left hand side to see what results you could end up with!

## Setting Up

We will be creating a simple project which is hosted by this p5.js library.

1. Firstly, create a new project in your preferred IDE. If you don't know how to do that, this website will walk you through.

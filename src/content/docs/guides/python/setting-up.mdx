There are many ways to set up your Python environment with different advantages and disadvantages. This guide will help you get fully setup to start coding in Python.

## Local development

This is the most flexible option as you can use any IDE you want and does not rely on an internet connection. This should be done on your personal computer and not on a school computer. This option also has the most complexity and learning due to all advanced features being available immediately. To use this option you will need to install Python and a code editor. You can download Python from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You can use any code editor you want, but we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Installing Python

There are multiple ways to install Python, but the easiest way is to download the latest version from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once you have downloaded the installer you can run it and follow the instructions to install Python.

You can also install python using a package manager for a more advanced setup.
- For macOS you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).
- If you are using Linux you can use your distro's package manager.
- If you are using Windows you can use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org).

<TabItem label="Chocolatey">

```sh
choco install python
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Homebrew">

```sh
brew install python
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Linux">

```sh
sudo apt install python3
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="asdf">

```sh
asdf plugin add python
asdf install python latest
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip[Not sure how to run commands?]
If you are not sure how to run commands we recommend installing python using the installer from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
:::

Once you have installed Python you can check that it has installed correctly by running the following command:

```sh
python --version
```

:::note[How to run commands on your computer]
To run commands on your computer you will need to open a terminal. On macOS and Linux you can open a terminal by pressing `⌘ + Space` and typing `Terminal`. On Windows you can open a command prompt terminal by pressing `⊞ + R`, and typing `cmd` or open Windows PowerShell by right-clicking the windows logo and selecting `Windows PowerShell`. You can then run the command by typing it into the terminal and pressing `Enter`. 
:::

You should get an output similar to the following:

```sh
Python 3.11.1
```

### Setting up a project

To set up a project you will need to create a new folder for your project. You can then open this folder in your code editor. You will also need to setup the virtual environment for your project. You can do this by running the following command:

```sh
poetry init
```

This will create a `pyproject.toml` file in your project folder. This file contains all the information about your project and is used by Python Poetry to manage your project. You can then install libraries using Python Poetry.

### Adding libraries

You can add libraries to your project by running the following command:

```sh
poetry add <library>
```

## Next steps

### Using Python Poetry

### Useful libraries

There are several libraries that are useful when programming in Python and can help with either style/formatting or type checking.

#### Style and formatting

These libraries help with formatting and style of your code, they can be used to automatically format your code to a standard style and can also be used to check your code for style errors. They should be added to your style dependencies using the below commands.

- [Black Formatter](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)

You can add them by running the following commands:

```sh
poetry add black flake8 --group test
```

##### Using Black Formatter

Black is a Python formatter that will automatically format your code to a standard style. You can run Black by running the following command:

```sh
poetry run black .
```

##### Using Flake8

Flake8 is a Python linter that will check your code for style errors. You can run Flake8 by running the following command:

```sh
poetry run flake8 .
```

#### Type checking

These libraries help with type checking your code, they can be used to check your code for type errors. They should be added to the test dependencies using the below commands.

- [MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

You can add them by running the following command:

```sh
poetry add mypy --group test
```

##### Using MyPy

MyPy is a Python type checker that will check your code for type errors. You can run MyPy by running the following command:

```sh
poetry run mypy .
```

**This guide assumes you've gone through the basics guide.**

Bullet heaven games are the opposite of the ever-popular bullet hell genre.

The player slowly accumulates a variety of abilities that activate automatically and fire an absurd amount of bullets at an equally absurd amount of enemies that slowly advance towards the player.

Bullet heaven games are usually from a top-down perspective.

The genre initially got popular from the Unity game Vampire Survivors.  
Although one of the most well-known Godot games, Brotato, has seen a good amount of fame after the popularity of Vampire Survivors brought attention to the concept of a bullet heaven.

For this we will make a simple 2D top-down character controller. A selection of abilities that fire projectiles periodically. Enemies that spawn outside the screen and then slowly advance towards the player. Along the way, we'll also need a health and score system.

## Top-Down 2D Character Controller

As seen in the [basics guide](../basics), the built-in Godot **CharacterBody2D** template is a side-on character controller.

Bullet heaven games are typically top-down, so let's make a top-down 2D character controller.

### Setting Up

The player doesn't need a floor to stand on, so we don't need to make a 2D scene. You can just start with making a scene with the root node **CharacterBody2D**.

Make the following scene:
- **CharacterBody2D**
	+ **CollisionShape2D** - Set shape to **New RectangleShape2D**
	+ **Sprite2D** - Set texture to **New PlaceholderTexture2D**
	+ **Camera2D**

Make the player's collider and sprite about an eighth the size of the camera's size, and a square. You want enough room between your player and the edge of the screen so they have time to react to enemies.

Set the **CharacterBody2D**'s **Motion Mode** property to **Floating**. Grounded is for 2D side-on games, floating is for top-down.

Enable the camera's **Position Smoothing** property so it's clear if the player is moving or not.

Add up, down, left, and right to the **Input Map**.

Give the player the default script, we'll modify it.

Since we're editing the player scene instead of the main scene the actual game is going to run in, when you want to run your game use **F6** instead of **F5**, or the **Run Current Scene** button instead of the **Run Project** button.

#### Changing the Script

Before anything else give this script the class name **Player**. The enemies will also be **CharacterBody2D** so later when we make checks if we check a body against **CharacterBody2D** it'll return true for players and enemies, when we might only want enemies or the player.  
To give the script the class name, below `extends CharacterBody2D`, add `class_name Player`.

Then, delete the `gravity` variable from the top of the script and then the section changing the y velocity based on gravity and jumping. There is no traditional gravity or jumping in top-down games.

The default script for a **CharacterBody2D** has this section to move the player:

```gdscript
# Get the input direction and handle the movement/deceleration.
# As good practice, you should replace UI actions with custom gameplay actions.
var direction = Input.get_axis("ui_left", "ui_right")

if direction:
	velocity.x = direction * SPEED
else:
	velocity.x = move_toward(velocity.x, 0, SPEED)

move_and_slide()
```

The `Input.get_axis` function is essentially a shorthand for getting the action strength of each action and taking it away from one another. So it says in the documentation if we hold ctrl and click on `get_axis`:

```
float get_axis(negative_action: StringName, positive_action: StringName) const

Get axis input by specifying two actions, one negative and one positive.

This is a shorthand for writing Input.get_action_strength("positive_action") - Input.get_action_strength("negative_action").
```

The action strength is calculated by how far down an action is pressed. Typical keyboards will not have action strength being sent. It's useful for joysticks, Hall Effect keyboards, and a few other niche use-cases. There is no four-directional `get_axis` so we'll have to use `get_axis` twice, once for the x and once for the y-axis.

Change the `direction` variable to `x_direction`, and replace the UI actions, like the template suggests, with your own left and right actions.
Make a second `y_direction` variable with your up and down actions.

Change the default if-else statement to use `x_direction` instead of `direction`, and then copy paste it so that there's also one for `y_direction`.

Your script should look something like:

```gdscript
func _physics_process(_delta):
	var x_direction = Input.get_axis("left", "right")
	var y_direction = Input.get_axis("up", "down")
	
	if x_direction:
		velocity.x = x_direction * SPEED
	else:
		velocity.x = move_toward(velocity.x, 0, SPEED)
	
	if y_direction:
		velocity.y = y_direction * SPEED
	else:
		velocity.y = move_toward(velocity.y, 0, SPEED)
	
	move_and_slide()
```

Run your game with **F6** or **Run Current Scene** since this isn't the main game scene.

If you've done all correctly, it should look like your player is moving. Make sure the camera's position smoothing is enabled. Otherwise, when your player moves, the camera also moves perfectly with them. It results in looking like the player is perfectly still.

## Enemies

Enemies in bullet heaven game's enemies are usually very simple. The difficulty comes from just how many of them there are and having to duck and dodge through the hoards while your weapons go to work.

Typically, there are a few types. But since most of the variation comes from just switching up how much health they have, how big their hitbox is, and other minor things, you can make new inherited scenes later after we build our basic enemy.

Since we need to test out the enemy scene in conjunction with the player scene, make a `main.tscn` scene with a **Node2D** root node.

If you pressed used **F5**/**Run Project** instead of **F6**/**Run Current Scene** for your player and set your main scene to be the player scene, go to **Project > Project Settings... > Run** and change the main scene to your new scene.

Use the chain-looking button next to the **Add Child Node** button in the **Scene** dock to instantiate your player scene as a child of your **Node2D** root node.

### Setting Up

Make a new scene with the root node **CharacterBody2D** and call it something like `enemy.tscn`.

Give the **CharacterBody2D** the usual **CollisionShape2D** and **Sprite2D** children with the usual **RectangleShape2D** and **PlaceholderTexture2D** shape and texture. Size them to be about the same size as the player, but slightly smaller so we can fit more in and somewhat visually distinct them from the player.

Set the **CharacterBody2D**'s **Motion Mode** property to **Floating** like you did with the player.

Instantiate your enemy scene in your main scene and move the instantiated enemy away from the player. Run your game with **F5**/**Run Project** and set the main scene as the main scene of the project if you haven't already. Now you have a point in which you can tell if your player is actually moving or not. The enemy does nothing without a script, so let's give it one.

Finally, this enemy is going to need a way to reduce the player's health. However, the player has no health variable yet. In your singleton, which you can find how to make one above in the **Universal Features** section, add a new `player_health` variable and set it to 100.

### Script

Get rid of everything below the line `func _physics_process(delta):` and above `move_and_slide()`, but not those lines, and delete the `gravity` and `JUMP_VELOCITY` variables.

Give this script the class name `Enemy` with `class_name Enemy` below `extends CharacterBody2D`.

Reduce the speed from `300.0` to something like `100.0` or `150.0`. Enemies need to be slower than the player in bullet hell games because the challenge is from avoiding hoards of them while your weapons work. Not from conserving health for when an enemy unfairly tackles you out of nowhere, and you can't do anything to get away from it until your weapons finally take it down.

#### Moving Towards the Player

To move towards the player, we're going to need to find the player.

In your singleton, add an onready variable that holds the player.

In your player's script, add the built-in `_ready()` function and set the Singleton's player_node variable to the player itself.

The singleton script should look something like this:

```gdscript
extends Node

var player_health: int = 100
@onready var player_node: Player
```

The player script's ready function should look similar to:

```gdscript
func _ready():
	Singleton.player_node = self
```

:::note[Static typing]
Statically typing means that you are making sure that a variable stays as the type you want it to be. For example, if you don't want an integer (a whole number, without decimal places) to ever have decimal places, statially type the variable with `: int` after the name and before setting the value.

This is very, very useful for debugging later on, and making sure you don't make a mistake.

The reason we can statically type with `: Player` on the `player_node` variable is because we set the class name of the player script to be `Player`. In this case, it'll help ensure we don't accidentally set any other nodes to also be in the "player" group and also help Godot's code editor autocomplete any variables, functions, or signals we might have in the player script.

Other common use-cases are the basic types like `bool` (boolean, true or false), `float` (floating-point number, number with possible decimal places), `String` (text, defined with "quotes around it, like this"), or to set variables, like the `player_node` variable, with complex types like **CharacterBody2D** to have access to code-completion in the Godot editor.
:::

Now, to finally edit the enemy script itself.

Before `move_and_slide()` add the *totally* simple line:

```gdscript
velocity = global_position.direction_to(Singleton.player_node.global_position) * SPEED
```

Breakdown of this line:

First, with `Singleton.player_node.global_position` we get the player's global position, which is a Vector2 since it's the x and y position.

Next, we use `global_position.direction_to()` to get the direction to the player from the `global_position` of the enemy. It gets this direction in a Vector2, in which both x and y add up to 1. We call this a normalized vector, since it's used for simple directions instead of anything like magnitude or position or anything else.

Then, we multiply that normalized vector with `SPEED` so now the vector that adds up to 1 in the direction of the player, will multiply up to 1 times the value of speed to also indicate how fast the player should move.

Since we now have a variable that says the speed in which the player should move and the direction it should be moving in, in the form of a Vector2, we can make that the velocity of the enemy.

:::note[Vector maths]
Vector maths is a large part of making any video game, but it's not very hard after you get the basic idea that a vector can represent a lot of things and begin to understand that. Godot's docs have a genuinely wonderful page about vector maths.

[Check it out here!](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/math/vector_math.html) Please do read it, vectors are essential to any game developer in any engine. It's not very long, but it is quite a bit to wrap your mind around.
:::

Anyway, the enemy should now move towards the player. Hooray!

#### Dealing Damage

Start by making a damage constant value at the top of your script next to the speed constant. Make it something like 5 and name it something in all caps since it's a constant, like `DAMAGE`.

Every time you call `move_and_slide()` it's taking the velocity variable of the **CharacterBody2D**, then moves the player that much, then checks for collisions and slides the player along any collisions it makes, then it stores what collisions have been made.

If we look at the **CharacterBody2D** in **Search Help**, we can see a list of properties and methods that might be helpful:

```gdscript
void apply_floor_snap ( )

float get_floor_angle ( Vector2 up_direction=Vector2(0, -1) ) const
Vector2 get_floor_normal ( ) const
Vector2 get_last_motion ( ) const
KinematicCollision2D get_last_slide_collision ( )
Vector2 get_platform_velocity ( ) const
Vector2 get_position_delta ( ) const
Vector2 get_real_velocity ( ) const
KinematicCollision2D get_slide_collision ( int slide_idx )
int get_slide_collision_count ( ) const
Vector2 get_wall_normal ( ) const

bool is_on_ceiling ( ) const
bool is_on_ceiling_only ( ) const
bool is_on_floor ( ) const
bool is_on_floor_only ( ) const
bool is_on_wall ( ) const
bool is_on_wall_only ( ) const
bool move_and_slide ( )
```

Here we can see there's the `get_slide_collision` and `get_slide_collision_count` methods. If we look at the description of `get_slide_collision` there's an explanation and a block of code showing us how to use both methods in conjunction to go through all the collided objects.

If you're eagle-eyed, you might have also spotted the `get_last_slide_collision` method. We don't want to use this because it only returns the last collision made, not all the collisions made. With how many enemies the game has it's not going to be unlikely that the enemy will hit the player and then slide into another enemy in the same frame. Just checking the last slide collision won't work, so we'll use the other two-slide collision methods to check every collision made.

Use the provided code-block in the `get_slide_collision` description and modify it so that instead of the print statement in the for-loop, add this:

```gdscript
if collision.get_collider() is Player:
	Singleton.player_health -= DAMAGE
	queue_free()
```

For this simple game, we're just going to run `queue_free()` so the player does damage and then disappears, so the next enemy can deal damage. If we didn't do this, it would deal damage every single frame the player is touching the enemy and it would deal insane amounts of damage very quickly.

If you want, you can use a **Timer** node, set it to one shot, replace `queue_free()` with starting the timer, and then check if the timer is stopped as part of the `if collision.get_collider() is Player:` if statement. This would stop the enemy from doing insane damage and limit it to once whenever the timer's value was set at.

In theory, what we have now though should work. Of course, we don't have anything to tell us how much health the player has, so let's quickly make death and a health bar.

## Health and Death

### Health Bar

Let's start with a simple health bar.

In your player scene, add a **ProgressBar** as a child of the root node. Position it above the player and make it wider so you can see the bar's progress.

Set the **Value** property of the **ProgressBar** to 100, this is your health bar.

Get the health bar in your player's script by opening the player's script, dragging the node to the top of the script where you want the variable, and before you release the left mouse button hold control. This will make the entire onready variable for you.

At the beginning of `_physics_process(delta)` add a line that sets the **ProgressBar**'s value property to the same value as your singleton's player health value. This is assuming your maximum health is 100. If it's something else you need to change the **Max Value** property on your health bar.

### Restarting Game

Next comes the death.

Make a new constant for your player's max health. This is just so we can reset the health to this value. It's good practice to not have random numbers lying around your scripts, and instead use constants with descriptive names.

Add in the `_physics_process(delta)` function to your singleton.

Give it a simple if statement, checking if the player's health is below or equal to 0.

Inside that, set your player's health to the max health constant you made before. Then run `get_tree().reload_current_scene()`. It's important you do it in that order, reloading the scene could stop the script from running in other circumstances and not reset the player's health. It shouldn't in this case since this is an autoload script and won't be reset, but it's still best practice to reload or change scenes after doing all other reset or changing operations in case your scene has anything to change in the singleton itself.

Since we set the `player_node` variable during the player's `_ready()` function, we don't need to set it again. It's going to change the variable when the node is made and enters the scene tree.

Booyah, the player can now die!

## Spawning

Spawning in objects is a crucial part of a great deal of games.

In Godot, we first need a scene to instantiate. Instantiating something means making a copy of it, AKA making an instance of it.

Next, we need to set any variables it might need.

Finally, add it to the scene tree so it's actually in the game world.  
This will be when the `@onready` variables and the `_ready` function finally run, since they run when a node is added to the scene tree. After those run, it'll begin `_physics_process` and `_process`.

### Enemies

The way we spawn enemies is ultimately up to you. You could spawn them at random points around the map but not on the player, you could make a bunch of spawners that continuously spew enemies, perhaps make it a goal to close all the spawners.

For now, we're just going to spawn enemies around the player, but just outside their camera.

Make a **Path2D** node as a child of **Camera2D** in your player scene, then a **PathFollow2D** node and a **Timer** node as a child of **Path2D**.

The Godot docs have [a perfect example of doing this](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/05.the_main_game_scene.html#spawning-mobs), it's recommended you go through the **Spawning Mobs** section there to make the points on your **Path2D**, but we'll go through it quickly too.

Select **Path2D** and use the green tool in the toolbar's **Path2D** tools, **Add Point**. This tool is used to add points to the path. Also, toggle on the **Use Smart Snap** and **Use Grid Snap** options in the toolbar.

In clockwise order, use the **Add Point** tool and select all four corners of the camera's pink boundary to create a path. After doing the final corner, use the final **Path2D** tool that comes before **Options**, **Close Curve**, to connect the path back to the beginning.

:::danger[Resizing Screen]
The Godot docs don't mention this at the time of making this **Path2D** way, but this doesn't scale with the screen. If you even maximize the window that Godot makes for the game, it won't scale.

To fix this go to **Project > Project Settings... > General** (tab) **> Display** (category) **> Window > Stretch** (section). Change **Mode** to `canvas_items` and **Aspect** to `keep`.

This will make it so you see the exact same window and aspect ratio as everyone else. It also means that people with different aspect ratio monitors will get ugly and awful black bars to fit it into their monitor.

If you're really confident in your programming skills, try using the `size_changed` signal on `get_tree().root` to move the points of the **Path2D** when the window is resized.
:::

#### Script

Add a script to your **Path2D**. 

Turn **Autostart** on for the **Timer** and set its wait time to something like 5 seconds., then connect its `timeout()` signal to the mob spawner (your **Path2D**).

Get both the spawn location (**PathFollow2D**) and the spawn timer as variables by dragging the nodes into the script and holding ctrl before releasing click. Do the same thing with the enemy scene in your **FileSystem** dock.

At the top of your global variables in the script, add the line:

```gdscript
@export_range(0.0, 1.0, 0.01) var respawn_delta: float = 0.99
```

All this does is make a custom property appear on the node that can be changed in the editor without having to go into the script. This lets us quickly and easily change how quickly the spawn timer's wait time decreases. It's good to keep this close to 1 since it's exponential.

In the function connected to the timer's `timeout()` signal, write the following:

```gdscript
var new_enemy: Enemy = ENEMY.instantiate()
spawn_location.progress_ratio = randf()
new_enemy.global_position  = spawn_location.global_position
get_tree().root.add_child(new_enemy)

spawn_timer.wait_time *= respawn_delta
```

This script assumes you renamed your **NodeFollow2D** to **SpawnLocation** and your **Timer** to **SpawnTimer** before generating the variables for them by dragging them in. You can also just rename the variables to `spawn_location` and `spawn_timer.`

This script has an issue. I doubt you'll be able to find it without playing the game for a few runs. But otherwise, this should work! Try playing your magical game a few times.

Have you noticed the problem yet?

Enemies don't disappear when the player dies!

Go back through and try to figure out what's causing this, there will be no explanation, just a solution. Hint: you may want to think about how the singleton doesn't reset, either.

Add this code:

```gdscript
var main_node: Node2D

func _ready():
	main_node = get_node("/root/Main")
```

Replace `Main` with the name of your main scene's root node.

Replace `get_tree().root.add_child(new_enemy)` with `main_node.add_child(new_enemy)` in the connected `timeout()` function.

### Weapon Projectiles

#### Making a Simple Bullet

We need a scene to spawn in, quickly setup this in a new scene:

- **Area2D**
	+ **CollisionShape2D**
	+ **Sprite2D**

Give it a script and connect the **Area2D**'s own `on_body_entered` signal to itself

Make a new global variable inside your bullet script called something like `direction` or `fire_direction`.

Make a new global constant as well, for the `SPEED` of the bullet. Your player moves at speed 300 by default, so try something around 500-700.

In a `_physics_process(delta)` function, add `direction * speed * delta` to `position`. We multiply by `delta` because we're manually moving the position instead of using **CharacterBody2D**'s `move_and_slide()` function which does that for you. `delta` is the time between the last physics frame and this one.

:::note[Fast moving bullets]
If you increase your bullet's speed by a lot it might move over the enemy in the span of a frame. This means it won't detect its collision.

Continuous Collision Detection (CCD) is used to counteract this. With **RigidBody2D** you can enable CCD. To do this, make the root node of your bullet a **RigidBody2D**. Enable **Continuous CD** in **RigidBody2D > Solver** in the inspector.

You'll have to use **RigidBody2D**'s available methods and signals to form this, which won't be as simple. Also, it won't be as fast.

If you want fast bullets a better way would be to add a **RayCast2D** to your player and just see if anything is colliding in its path when firing. Use multiple ray casts for making bullet width. This doesn't come with having any feedback that the player fired a bullet to kill the enemy. If you can make a kill animation or some sort of way to tell the player they fired, it's the best way to make fast firing bullets.

This is also how hit-scan works in all FPS games, if you are aware of the concept.
:::

In your function connected to the `on_body_entered` signal, enter:

```gdscript
if body is Enemy:
	body.queue_free()
```

All in all, these will move the projectile every frame in an unspecified direction, and then when it runs into an enemy it'll delete it.

#### Spawning the Bullet

We don't want to spawn a bullet every frame or physics frame, so we can't use `_process` or `_physics_process` to spawn in a bullet.

Add a **Timer** node to your player scene.

In the **Inspector**, set the wait time to be how long you want between shots. Turn **Autostart** on so it starts when the game plays. Leave **One Shot** off so that it repeats the timer.

:::note[SRP]
Now, we *could* just connect the `timeout` signal to our player script. But as previously mentioned, it's a good idea to split your project up into as many files as possible for every different use.

The single responsibility principle (SRP) is mentioned several times across godot's [best practices docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/best_practices/introduction_best_practices.html).

In essence, keeps scripts/functions/nodes to just one use. In this case, the **Timer** node is purely for spawning and shooting off projectiles.
:::

Add a script to the projectile spawner **Timer** node and connect its own `timeout` signal to itself.

This is very similar to spawning in enemies. Make a new global variable in the script for the main node, in the `_ready` function set that node to `get_node("/root/Main") or your equivalent.

Then, from the **FileSystem** dock, find and drag your bullet scene into your script, and before you release the mouse hold control.

In your function connected to the `timeout` signal, make a new variable set to an instance of the scene.

Get your player as an `@onready` variable by dragging it into the script and holding control before letting go.

Back in the function, set that variable's `direction`, or equivalent, value to `player.velocity.normalized()`. Do the same with the projectile's and your player's `global_position`.

Then, add it as a child of your main scene's root node.

#### Automatic Aiming

Play your game!

If you've played a bullet heaven game before you'll quickly realize what's missing. The bullets move in the same direction as you move.

This is bad for a few reasons. If you stand still the bullets don't fire off. It's awkward and counter-intuitive to move towards your enemies to fire at them. Also, it's not in the bullet heaven style.

Normally, weapons automatically fire at the closest enemy.

There are a couple ways we could do this.

First, we could put the enemy body in a group called something like "enemy". Then, we'd use a for loop and loop through all the enemies in 		`get_tree().get_nodes_in_group()` and compare them all to find the closest one.

However, that'll get very slow when you have a lot of enemies. Since you have to go through potentially hundreds of enemies everytime you spawn a bullet, which will be happening pretty often if rapid-fire weapons are introduced.

The best way around this is to limit your calculations to a smaller area. This also provides the benefit of not firing at a random enemy a long distance away for no reason.

Add an **Area2D** node with a collider, and make it a circle that's a bit wider than the camera.

Get a reference to that **Area2D** in your projectile spawner. Before instantiating the projectile add:

```gdscript
var closest_enemy: Enemy
	for body in fire_radius.get_overlapping_bodies():
		if body is Enemy:
			if is_instance_valid(closest_enemy):
				if player.global_position.distance_squared_to(body.global_position) < player.global_position.distance_squared_to(closest_enemy.global_position):
					closest_enemy = body
			else:
				closest_enemy = body
	if not is_instance_valid(closest_enemy):
		return
```

Let's break this down.

We have a `closest_enemy` variable which will be an object of type `Enemy`, this assumes you have named your enemy class `Enemy`.

We use that and loop through all of the overlapping bodies in our **Area2D**, this assumes the name of your **Area2D** variable is `fire_radius`. If the body that we're looping over is not an enemy, don't do anything with it. It might be a wall and we don't want to target walls.

We need to find the closest enemy. We can't check if the currently looped enemy is closer than `closest_enemy` if `closest_enemy` isn't set to any enemy at all. So if `closest_enemy` isn't a valid instance we just set it to that currently looped enemy. If we only have a single overlapping enemy this is where the loop would end.

On the next loop, if there are multiple enemies in the area we next need to check if that second looped enemy is closer to the player than `closest_enemy` or not. If it is, it becomes the new `closest_enemy`. We use `distance_squared_to` instead of `distance_to` because it's a lot faster.

Finally, check if we found an enemy at all. If not, `return` and stop the rest of the function that spawns a bullet.

Next, after this block of code and after you instantiate the bullet, you need to replace `new_projectile.direction = player.velocity.normalized()` with `new_projectile.direction = player.global_position.direction_to(closest_enemy.global_position)`. This will finally set the direction to the enemy. `direction_to` returns a normalized vector already, so we don't need to use `normalized` on it.

Play your magical game after modifying the names of variables to your specific script. If all is well, this will work.

## Weapon select

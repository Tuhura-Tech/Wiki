This is a set of resources covering 3 internals that builds a working website. The core functionality is in Python with the frontend in HTML/CSS and a SQL database. A blog is used as the example throughout this resource as it covers all the criteria of knowledge for excellence with easy transferable skills to whatever you build. The covered internal are:

- Programming [AS91896](https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nqfdocs/ncea-resource/achievements/2019/as91896.pdf) (6 credits)
- Database [AS91892](https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nqfdocs/ncea-resource/achievements/2019/as91892.pdf) (4 credits)
- Media (Web) [AS91893](https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nqfdocs/ncea-resource/achievements/2019/as91893.pdf) (4 credits)

## Knowledge Required

Basic familiarity with Python, Flask, HTML/CSS and SQL will be needed to build this website with guides available for each of these topics:

- [Flask](/guides/python/flask)
- [Python](/guides/python/)
- [HTML/CSS](/guides/web/)
- [SQL](/guides/sql/)

### What is used

Different libraries and frameworks are used to allow the website to be used and their details can be found below:

- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) - functionality
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) - styling
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) - database

## What is Flask? What are we doing?

Flask is a web framework that can be used in Python to build websites or other web applications. It is a very popular framework and is used by many large companies such as Pinterest, LinkedIn and Netflix. Flask is very easy to use and is a great way to learn how to build websites. It is used as a library in Python which means its a bundle of code you can use and customise in your own code.

### Device Requirements

If you are doing local development you will need a modern computer running either Linux, Windows 10/11 or MacOS (Chromebooks do not work).

- [Python](https://python.org/downloads) v3.12+ (the latest version is always recommended as its faster and has better error messages).
- [IDE](https://vscodium.com) any modern IDE can be used with VSCodium recommended.

### Getting Setup

To setup your python project you should follow the [guide](/guides/python/setting-up) and install these dependencies:

- flask

## What is Git?

Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to files and collaborate with other people. It was built by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, and is used by many open source projects and large companies like Google, Facebook and Microsoft. Each file is tracked along with who made the changes and when. This allows you to easily see what has changed and who made the changes. It also allows you to easily revert changes if you make a mistake.
